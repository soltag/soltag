**Your on-chain proof of real-world attendance**

SOLTAG is a privacy-first mobile dApp that mints non-transferable NFT credentials (Soulbound Tokens) to prove you attended real-world events. It achieves this without strictly tracking users or storing raw GPS coordinates on-chain, ensuring complete user privacy.

Designed for robust verification at conferences, meetups, gyms, and DAO governance events on Solana.

## Core Concept

**The Problem**
Traditional attendance tracking relies on centralized databases (sign-in sheets, Web2 apps) which are prone to data leaks, or they require invasive GPS tracking that compromises user privacy. Furthermore, simple POAPs can often be minted from anywhere, failing to prove physical presence.

**The SOLTAG Solution**
Soltag verifies physical presence through a multi-layered approach:
1.  **Zone Validation:** The app locally verifies if the device is within the event's geofence (using privacy-preserving geohashes) before allowing a scan.
2.  **Cryptographic Proof:** Scanned QR codes contain a signed payload that expires quickly, preventing replay attacks.
3.  **Hardware Attestation:** (On supported devices) The app leverages the Solana Seeker's Secure Element to prove the request originates from a genuine, uncompromised device.

## Key Features

### Mobile Experience
*   **Privacy-First Onboarding:** No email, phone number, or social login required. Users simply connect their Solana wallet.
*   **Hardware Integration:** Fully optimized for **Solana Seeker**, utilizing the Seed Vault for signing and the Secure Element for device attestation to prevent bot farming.
*   **Offline Support:** Built with an "Offline First" architecture. Users can scan and verify codes even with spotty connectivity; transactions are queued and submitted when online.
*   **Modern UI:** A sleek, high-performance interface built with React and Ionic/Capacitor, featuring Dark Mode and glassmorphism transparency effects using **Lucide React** icons.

### Leaderboard & Reputation
*   **Global Rankings:** Users gain reputation points for every verified event, competing on global and monthly leaderboards.
*   **Seeker Verification:** Exclusive visual indicators (Shield Badge) for users verifying via Seeker hardware, establishing a higher tier of trust.
*   **Profile Customization:** Users can set a local username and avatar. This data is stored on-device to respect privacy, while the wallet address serves as the global identifier.

### Security Modules
*   **QR Validator:** Implements Ed25519 signature verification on QR payloads to ensure they were generated by the event organizer.
*   **Secure Storage:** Uses AES-GCM encryption to store sensitive session keys and wallet adapters locally.
*   **Zone Privacy:** Location verification uses Geohash precision level 5 (~5km radius) combined with SHA-256 hashing. Raw GPS coordinates are never sent to the server or blockchain.
